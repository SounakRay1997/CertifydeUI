# Certifyde

Certifyde is an end to end solution that caters to the needs of both candidates and recruiters. For candidates, it offers a way to keep track of their ongoing and completed courses across multiple course platforms i.e coursera, udemy and udacity, and recommends courses based on their interests and previous courses. For recruiters,  Certifyde offers a way to view prospective candidates based on area of interest, courses done and also offers a way to contact them. The application is developed with a React frontend, and an Amazon Web Services Backend. The key AWS components used are S3, API Gateway, Lambda, OpenSearch, DynamoDB, Sagemaker and Simple Email Service. The application mainly deals with two kinds of data, viz. the user data and the course data. The user data is used to check for recommendations and for recruiters to contact the user/candidates of Certifyde. The recommendations are built on a dataset composed of more than 4300 courses.
